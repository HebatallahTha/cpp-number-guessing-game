# 🎮 C++ Number Guessing Game

This **C++ program** is a fun number-guessing game that can be played by one or two players. The players (either a human or a computer) each choose a number between 1 and 100, and the game determines the winner based on whether the highest or lowest number wins (chosen randomly). It showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual functions.

## ✨ Features  
- 🤖 **Computer Player**: The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- 👤 **Human Player**: The human enters a number between 1 and 100.
- 🎲 **Game Mode**: You can play against the computer or another human player.
- 🏆 **Randomized Winning Conditions**: The game randomly selects whether the highest or lowest number wins.
- 🔄 **Replayability**: After each round, you can choose to play again.
